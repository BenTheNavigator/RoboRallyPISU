# GuideToStart
- In your MySQL write: 
- CREATE DATABASE pisd;
- USE pisd;
- Execute both.


- Follow the guide in: 
src/main/java/dk/dtu/compute/se/pisd/roborally/dal/TemplateDBCredentials.txt


- Start the program by running StartRoboRally in: 
src/main/java/dk/dtu/compute/se/pisd/roborally/StartRoboRally

- If the application is to big or small for your screen, you can adjust its size, by changing the following code numbers, in the following path:
src/main/java/dk/compute/se/pisd/roborally/view/Spaceview
   - final public static int SPACE_HEIGHT = 40; // 60; // 75; line 52
   - final public static int SPACE_WIDTH = 40;  // 60; // 75; line 53
   - You can adjust the first number (40), by replacing it with a higher number to make the application bigger, or a smaller number to make the application smaller. This must be done for both lines of code and the number should be the same on both lines for the best out come.
